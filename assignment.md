# Title

> Give your latest & greatest perspective piece an informative title that makes it clear what your perspective piece is about but is not quite as boring as most journal article titles. For example: `A fight for scraps of ammonia` is the title of a [recent Nature News&Views perspective](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v549/n7671/full/549162a.html) about the article `Kinetic analysis of a complete nitrifier reveals an oligotrophic lifestyle`.

#### Article: [Citation](www.???.com/pathtoarticle)

> Provide the citation (authors, title, journal and year) and web address of the article your perspective piece is about in the form of a link: `[Citation](www.???.com/articleaddress)`. Example: [Kits et al. Kinetic analysis of a complete nitrifier reveals an oligotrophic lifestyle. Nature, 2017](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v549/n7671/full/nature23679.html). If it is an older journal article that may not have a direct web address, please add the PDF of the article to your repository and link to the file instead of a webpage (i.e. use `[Citation](pathtoarticle.pdf)` instead, just like with images).

#### Summary

> Provide a one or two sentence summary of your perspective. This is sometimes easier to write at the very end after finishing the main text itself.

## Perspective

> Add the main text of your perspective. This should include a little bit of background to contextualize the study you are writing about, followed by your explanation of the most interesting aspects of the article (e.g. - problem, data, methods, results, interpretation), and finishing with your take on what that might mean for future research (or how it influenced the research that followed in case of a classic paper). Make sure to place your figure where it fits best and feel free to use subheadings (`### Subheading` or `#### Sub-subheading`) and other markdown styling (e.g. `*italics*` and `**bold**`) to structure your text as you see fit.

*Figure 1: Example Caption*

> Include one original color figure hat helps explain the aspects of the study you discuss in this perspective. If you have a preferred graphics program that you are already familiar with, feel free to use it for this figure. If you don't already have one, I recommend using the free online diagram editor [www.draw.io](https://www.draw.io/), which you can link directly to your GitHub account to save/load the `.xml` diagram files to/from your repository (or link it to google drive if you prefer). For eventual inclusion in this document, make sure that you save your figure in `.png` or `.jpeg/.jpg` format in the `figures` folder. In [www.draw.io](https://www.draw.io/), you can do this for example via `File -> Export as -> JPEG...`.

#### Word Count:

> Check your word count. The maximum is 1000 words excluding references.
