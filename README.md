# Latest & Greatest Assignment

For this assignment, you will write a short perspective piece on a recently published or classic study broadly related to your chosen term project. The goal is to emulate the style, feeling, and intent of a Nature "News & Views" perspective article. These articles are limited to 1000 words (excluding references). They should have more than 4 but less than 12 references, and one original color figure that helps explain the interesting aspects of the study being discussed (e.g. - problem, data, methods, results, interpretation). Make it visually appealing. Additional details are provided in the [`latest_greatest.md`](latest_greatest.md).

#### Paper selection

You will probably need to read through a few papers to find one that is suitable. Attached below is a list of some common journals for geomicrobiology research. Choose a paper that:

 - is exciting to you
 - makes/made a breakthrough, however small, in understanding an important aspect of your term project topic
 - was either published in the past 2 months (*latest*), OR represents a very important classic in your topic area (*greatest*)

Note that just because a paper already has a published perspective piece, you can still use it for your L&G, particularly if you disagree with the perspective or see the importance of the study differently.

#### Potential Journals

You should have access to most articles in these journals while on the CU Boulder network (or logged in via VPN).

#### Tips

  - for *latest* papers: try browsing the most recent issues of the journals or look at their *articles in press*
  - for *greatest* papers: see if you can identify a key publication on your topic from references in other articles or the reference lists of the text books (if any chapter touches on your topic area)

Some questions you can ask to get started: What problem is this paper addressing, and why is it important?  What approach did the authors bring to bear on this problem (e.g., new methods, inverse modeling, statistical reanalysis, new observations, new theory)?  Can you reconstruct the logic of the argument?  How were the data interpreted?  How could the data be interpreted?  What did the study do right?  What did it do wrong?  What is the next step?

## Assignment

1. Follow the instructions in the [`latest_greatest.md`](latest_greatest.md) to complete the assignment.
2. Submit your assignment to the `review` branch for review by one of your teammates (see tutorial video for details) by the L&G draft deadline (see [schedule](https://2017-geomicrobiology.github.io/schedule/)).
3. Review the draft of one of your teammates by the peer review deadline.
4. Revise your L&G based on your teammate's review.
5. Submit to the `submit` branch by the L&G revised final deadline.
6. On the day the final L&G is due you will be expected to give a brief (2 minute) summary of your L&G in class - what was exciting about the paper?

## Peer Review

Once you have completed the L&G, submit it for review by one of your teammates by creating a pull request with `review` as the base branch and your teammate as the reviewer (coordinate with your team to make sure everyone knows who to request as reviewer). Your teammates will do the same and it is your responsibility to review one of your teammates L&G. This version of the L&G will not be graded, however, a part of your grade will be based on giving your teammate a constructive review of their L&G.

## Submission

Once you have revised your L&G based on your teammate's review, submit by the usual method, i.e. creating a pull request with `submit` as the base branch and your instructor as the reviewer. The version in this pull request is the one that will be graded.

## Grading

Grading is based on the final submission after revisions based on teammate feedback with a small component based on your review of your teammate's draft.
